' Choose the appropriate diagram type based on your pattern category:

' For Microservices Architecture
skinparam component {
  BackgroundColor White
  BorderColor Black
}
component "Client" as client
component "Load Balancer" as lb
component "Model Service 1" as ms1
component "Model Service 2" as ms2
component "Kubernetes Cluster" as k8s

client --> lb : HTTP
lb --> ms1 : route
lb --> ms2 : route
ms1 --> k8s : Docker
ms2 --> k8s : Docker

' For Agent-Based Architecture
package "Multi-Agent System" {
  component "Agent 1" as agent1
  component "Agent 2" as agent2
  component "Agent 3" as agent3
  database "Vector DB" as vdb
  component "Knowledge Base" as kb
  component "Communication Layer" as comm
  
  agent1 --> kb : coordination
  agent2 --> kb : coordination
  agent3 --> kb : coordination
  kb --> vdb : shared memory
  agent1 --> comm : inter-agent
  agent2 --> comm : inter-agent
  agent3 --> comm : inter-agent
}

' For Event-Driven Architecture
rectangle "Event Source" as es
rectangle "Message Broker" as mb
rectangle "Processor 1" as p1
rectangle "Processor 2" as p2
database "Result Store" as rs

es --> mb : publish
mb --> p1 : consume
mb --> p2 : consume
p1 --> rs : async result
p2 --> rs : async result

' For DAG Workflow Architecture
rectangle "Data Ingestion" as di
rectangle "Feature Engineering" as fe
rectangle "Model Training" as mt
rectangle "Validation" as val
rectangle "Model Registry" as mr
rectangle "Deployment" as deploy
rectangle "Monitoring" as mon

di --> fe
fe --> mt
mt --> val
val --> mr
mr --> deploy
deploy --> mon

' For Feature Store Architecture
rectangle "Raw Data" as raw
rectangle "Feature Engineering" as fe_proc
database "Offline Store\n(Parquet/HDFS)" as ofs
database "Online Store\n(Redis/Cassandra)" as ons
rectangle "Model Trainer" as trainer
rectangle "Model Scorer" as scorer

raw --> fe_proc
fe_proc --> ofs
fe_proc --> ons
