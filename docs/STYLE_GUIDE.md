# Documentation Style Guide

Follow these guidelines to keep documentation consistent and useful to ML engineers and architects.

## Writing

- Tone: concise, technical, and actionable.
- Use present tense and active voice.
- Keep examples minimal and runnable when possible.

## Structure for pattern pages

Use `templates/pattern-template.md` — the required sections are: Summary, Problem, Context, Solution, Diagram(s), Examples, References, Guardrails, Monitoring, Governance, Security, Testing, Reproducibility, Lifecycle, and Delivery Checklist.

## Filenames and slugs

- Use kebab-case for filenames: `model-deployment.md`.
- Keep paths consistent under `patterns/high-level` and `patterns/low-level`.

## Code samples

- Prefer short snippets; provide runnable examples in `examples/` when larger.
- Use fenced code blocks with a language tag.
